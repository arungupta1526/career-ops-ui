## [1.9.0] — 2026-05-08

P-6 → P-10 from the v1.8.0 backlog all shipped in one bundle. Headline: `server/index.mjs` is now a 130-LOC orchestrator (down from 762, total 1230 → 130 = -89%); every route topic has its own module. Anthropic parity for `/api/evaluate`, multi-CLI shims, expanded i18n parity test, and Playwright browser-smoke wired into CI.

### 🏗️ P-6 — server split-by-concern (phase 2)

Continuation of P-2. Extracted the remaining 9 route topics out of `server/index.mjs` into `server/lib/routes/<topic>.mjs` modules. `index.mjs` is now a pure orchestrator: middleware (security headers + activity log + static), 12 `register<Topic>Routes(app)` calls, and the SPA catch-all.

- `server/lib/routes/activity.mjs` — `/api/activity`.
- `server/lib/routes/config.mjs` — `/api/config` GET/POST (parent .env round-trip).
- `server/lib/routes/health.mjs` — `/api/health` + `/api/dashboard`.
- `server/lib/routes/help.mjs` — `/api/help/:lang`.
- `server/lib/routes/jds.mjs` — full CRUD for `jds/*.txt`.
- `server/lib/routes/llm.mjs` — every LLM-bound endpoint (evaluate, deep, mode, apply-helper, interview-prep).
- `server/lib/routes/pipeline.mjs` — `/api/pipeline*` including the SSRF-safe preview proxy with named constants for timeout / max-redirects / max-body.
- `server/lib/routes/reports.mjs` — `/api/reports*`.
- `server/lib/routes/tracker.mjs` — `/api/tracker` GET + dedup-aware POST.

Behavior unchanged. 283/283 unit tests stayed green at every step. The orchestrator's import surface dropped from 47 lines to 22.

### 🔌 P-7 — Anthropic parity for `/api/evaluate`

`/api/evaluate` previously was Gemini-or-manual. v1.9.0 adds an Anthropic branch (preferred when both keys present), mirroring the routing rule already used by `/api/deep` and `/api/mode/:slug`. Routes through `bundleProjectContext({ modeSlugs: ['_shared', 'oferta'] })` so the model has the cv / profile / mode templates inlined (REVIEW-A1).

New endpoint: **`POST /api/evaluate/test-anthropic`** — smoke check for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, mirrors the existing Gemini smoke. Sends a tiny prompt (≤256 output tokens) so it costs essentially nothing; returns a 200-char sample.

Fallback chain is now: Anthropic → Gemini → manual.

### 🌐 P-8 — Help-center i18n parity (audit + test hardening)

Audited every `docs/help/<lang>.md` for structure parity. All 8 locales already cover the same 14 canonical h2 sections. Tests upgraded:

- `tests/help-ui.test.mjs::every help doc covers the same 14 sections` was checking only en + ru. Now iterates **all 8 locales** (en, es, pt-BR, ko-KR, ja, ru, zh-CN, zh-TW) and asserts the section count for each.
- New test: `tests/help-ui.test.mjs::every help locale has substantive content` — guards against locale stubs by asserting each non-EN locale is at least 30% of `en.md`'s byte length. Compact translations naturally hit 40-50%; a stub would be in single-digit %.

Result: structural parity is now CI-enforced.

### 🤖 P-9 — Playwright browser smoke in CI matrix

`tests/playwright-smoke.mjs` (added in v1.8.0 as opt-in) is now part of the CI workflow. The existing `e2e` job already installs Playwright + Chromium; one new step (`npm run test:e2e:browser`) runs the 5 browser-smoke tests right after the comprehensive node E2E.

Order in CI: unit (Node 18/20/22 matrix) → smoke node E2E → comprehensive node E2E → **Playwright browser smoke** → screenshot artifact upload on failure.

### 🌍 P-10 — Multi-CLI compatibility

Parent career-ops v1.7.0 introduced multi-CLI / Open Agent Skill standard support. The UI sub-project follows the same convention with thin shims pointing at the canonical `CLAUDE.md`:

- `web-ui/AGENTS.md` — Codex / Aider / generic CLI entry point.
- `web-ui/GEMINI.md` — Gemini CLI entry point.

Both shims re-state the hard rules and quick reference but defer to `CLAUDE.md` for the full project-level instructions, so non-Claude CLIs land on the same orientation as Claude Code sessions. The deployed UI itself remains CLI-agnostic at runtime.

### 🧪 Tests

- **284 unit tests** (was 283): +1 new help-locale parity test.
- **5 Playwright browser-smoke tests** — now part of CI, not just opt-in.
- Coverage held.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-05-08

Hardening, refactor, and SDD bootstrap. Three high-severity correctness/security fixes (A1, A2, A3), four medium ones (B1–B4), six cleanups, audit of the parent career-ops v1.7.0 surface, server split-by-concern (P-2 phase 1), Playwright browser smoke harness, and a full SDD foundation under `docs/` and `.claude/`.

### 🔥 High-severity fixes

- **`fix(deep): inline cv/profile/mode files for Anthropic SDK calls (REVIEW-A1)`** — `/api/deep` and `/api/mode/:slug` previously told the model "read these files first" but the Anthropic SDK has no filesystem. Output was hollow. New `bundleProjectContext({ modeSlugs })` reads `cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `modes/_shared.md`, and the mode template, truncates each at 16 KB, and prepends a `<project_context>` block to the prompt. Verified live: 26 KB grounded markdown response from `claude-sonnet-4-6` for a deep-research call.
- **`fix(runner): SIGKILL escalation after SIGTERM grace period (REVIEW-A2)`** — `runNodeScript` and `streamNodeScript` previously sent only `SIGTERM` on timeout / client-disconnect. A child stuck in a syscall (DNS, blocked socket) ignored it, hanging the SSE connection until Node's GC reaped. Now each path arms a 5 s watchdog that escalates to `SIGKILL`. Promises always resolve.
- **`fix(runner): max-runtime cap on streaming endpoints (REVIEW-A3)`** — every SSE script runner (`/api/stream/{scan,liveness,pdf}`) now has a hard 30-minute ceiling. On expiry: emit `event: error { message: 'maximum runtime exceeded' }`, kill the child via the A2 watchdog, end the response.

### 🛡️ Medium-severity fixes

- **`fix(preview): per-hop redirect validation in /api/pipeline/preview (REVIEW-B1)`** — switched from `redirect: 'follow'` to manual redirect-walking. Each `Location` header is re-validated by `isValidJobUrl`; capped at 3 hops. Hostile boards can no longer bounce us to loopback / private IPs / `file://`. 4 new tests cover the rejection paths.
- **`refactor(keys): hasGeminiKey helper unifies LLM-key checks (REVIEW-B2)`** — direct `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` reads in route handlers replaced with `hasGeminiKey()` from `lib/anthropic.mjs`. Mirrors `hasAnthropicKey()` shape for consistency and easier mocking.
- **`feat(scanners): thread AbortSignal through hh.ru, Habr, Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever (REVIEW-B3)`** — when the SSE client disconnects mid-scan, in-flight HTTP fetches are now aborted instead of running every query to completion and dropping events. `runRuScan` and `runEnScan` accept `opts.signal`; SSE handlers in `/api/stream/scan-{ru,en}` create an `AbortController` and abort on `res.close`.
- **`test(anthropic): log-guard test prevents future API-key leaks via console (REVIEW-B4)`** — captures every `console.{log,info,warn,error,debug}` call during `runAnthropic` happy + error paths, asserts zero output and that the canary key string never appears. Defense-in-depth against a future `console.log(opts)` regression.

### 🧹 Low-severity polish

- **`fix(parsers): defense-in-depth URL gate inside addPipelineUrl (REVIEW-C4)`** — parser-level rejection of non-http(s) values, complementing the route-level `isValidJobUrl`. Optional `opts.validate` for callers that want stricter rules.
- **`docs(readme): badge "tests-88 passed" → "tests-277 passed" (REVIEW-C3)`** — was off by an order of magnitude.
- **`test(i18n): missing-keys diff grouped by locale (REVIEW-C6)`** — when `tests/i18n-coverage.test.mjs` finds a gap, output is now `[ru] (3): foo, bar, baz` instead of mixed lines.
- **`docs(review): C1 closed as resolved-on-inspection`** — sanitizer regexes were already in `\x00-\x08` hex form; review entry was a tool-rendering artifact.

### 🏗️ P-2 phase 1 — server split-by-concern

`server/index.mjs` was 1230 LOC, well past the 800-line ceiling. Split into focused modules without behavior change. All 283 unit tests stayed green at every step.

- `server/lib/security.mjs` — `isValidJobUrl`, `stripDangerousMarkdown`, `sanitizeJobDescription`, `isPubliclyExposed`. Re-exported from `index.mjs` for backward-compat with external consumers.
- `server/lib/prompts.mjs` — `bundleProjectContext`, `buildEvaluationPrompt`, `buildDeepPrompt`, `buildModePrompt`, `buildApplyChecklist`.
- `server/lib/store.mjs` — `safeReadApps`, `safeReadPipeline`, `safeListReports`, `checkProfileCustomized`, `ensureRussianPortalsDefaults`.
- `server/lib/routes/scan.mjs` — `registerScanRoutes(app)` for `/api/stream/scan-{ru,en}`, `/api/scan-ru/config`, `/api/scan-results`.
- `server/lib/routes/runners.mjs` — `registerRunnerRoutes(app)` for buffered `/api/run/*` table, streaming `/api/stream/{scan,liveness,pdf}`, generated-PDF list/download.
- `server/lib/routes/content.mjs` — `registerContentRoutes(app)` for CV / Profile / Portals / Modes.

`index.mjs` is now 762 LOC (-38%, under the 800 cap). Phase 2 will extract tracker, pipeline, reports, jds, llm (evaluate/deep/mode), and health into route modules. Targeting <500 LOC for the orchestrator.

### 🔍 Parent career-ops v1.7.0 audit

The user updated the parent project to v1.7.0. Audited every consumed surface — UI is fully compatible. Notable findings documented in `docs/architecture/DATA-FLOWS.md`:

- Modes catalog grew from 7 to 19 files. UI's `MODE_ALLOWLIST` deliberately surfaces only 7 (others are Claude-Code-only). Comment added explaining the intentional narrow scope.
- `portals.yml` schema confirmed: `tracked_companies` (96 entries, 87 enabled, 71 with API). EN scanner reads it correctly; legacy `companies` key still supported.
- New parent surfaces NOT consumed today: `dashboard/` (Go program), `update-system.mjs`, `generate-latex.mjs`, `analyze-patterns.mjs`, `liveness-core.mjs`, `followup-cadence.mjs`, `test-all.mjs`, localized mode subdirs (`de/fr/ja/pt/ru`).
- Live `/api/dashboard`, `/api/health`, `/api/modes`, `/api/portals`, `/api/profile`, `/api/cv`, `/api/jds`, `/api/reports`, `/api/tracker`, `/api/pipeline`, `/api/evaluate`, `/api/deep`, `/api/stream/scan-en` all verified green.

### 🤖 SDD / GSD bootstrap

`career-ops-ui` now has a full Spec-Driven Development foundation aligned with the GSD pipeline (`gsd-*` skills from `superpowers@claude-plugins-official`).

- `CLAUDE.md` (root) — project-level agent system prompt: stack, GSD pipeline, hard rules (parent contract, security envelope, no `--no-verify`), conventions, parent-project boundary.
- `.aiignore` — exclusion list for AI agents: vendored, binaries, parent user data, `.planning/`, `.env`, locale duplicates.
- `.claude/agents/` — three project-specific subagent definitions:
  - `web-ui-route-reviewer.md` — gates new routes against SSRF, CSP, sanitizers, parent-write contract, conventions, tests.
  - `spa-view-reviewer.md` — CSP-safe DOM, i18n, router registration, accessibility.
  - `test-isolation-reviewer.md` — verifies tests are CI-isolated (no parent-project assumptions, no live network, no port collision).
- `.claude/commands/` — slash-command stubs: `/sdd-status`, `/codebase-tour`.
- `docs/` tree — all in English:
  - `PROJECT.md` — what/why/for-whom, scope, constraints, success criteria.
  - `ROADMAP.md` — current milestone + completed history + backlog.
  - `sdd/SDD-GUIDE.md` — discuss → spec → plan → execute → verify → review pipeline mapped to `gsd-*` skills.
  - `sdd/CONVENTIONS.md` — module system, naming, routes, sanitizers, client patterns, i18n, errors, logging, testing, commits, branches, CSS.
  - `architecture/OVERVIEW.md` — top-level diagram, layers, boot sequence, invariants, "where to look first when…" cheat sheet.
  - `architecture/SERVER.md` — per-file map for `server/lib/*.mjs` (updated for P-2 split).
  - `architecture/FRONTEND.md` — SPA structure, view inventory, globals, "how to add a view".
  - `architecture/API.md` — full inventory of every `/api/*` route.
  - `architecture/DATA-FLOWS.md` — every parent-project read/write, with the explicit-user-action contract.
  - `reviews/REVIEW-2026-05-07.md` — static review that produced this changelog's fixes.

### 🔒 Security & repo hygiene

- **`chore(.gitignore): comprehensive defense-in-depth patterns`** — covers env variants, IDE folders, GSD scratch (`.planning/`), per-user agent settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/cache/`, `.claude/state/`, `.claude/memory/`), Playwright artifacts (`playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, `.playwright/`, `trace.zip`), heap/CPU profiles, lockfiles for unshipped tooling, expanded macOS Finder noise, generic secret patterns (`secrets.json`, `credentials.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`).

### 🧪 Tests

- **283 unit tests** (was 277): +6 new (4 for B1 redirect-rejection, 1 for `hasGeminiKey`, 1 for `runAnthropic` log-guard).
- **5 Playwright browser-smoke tests** (new, opt-in via `npm run test:e2e:browser`): dashboard render + version footer, dashboard → scan → pipeline → cv navigation, language-switch persistence, 404 view, health-page render. Resolves Playwright via parent's `node_modules` — no new dependency.
- Coverage held at ~93% line / ~83% branch.

### 📝 New / updated package.json scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run test:e2e:browser` | Run Playwright smoke harness against in-process server (5 tests). |

## [1.7.2] — 2026-05-04

Help center, in-UI App settings, mobile sidebar, single Scan button, and a "Show result" shortcut on every prompt-builder.

### ✨ New features

- **`feat(help): in-app user guide` (`/#/help`)** — long-form Markdown documentation accessible from a new sidebar entry. Covers every page step-by-step: quick start, CV editor, Profile, Scan filters, Pipeline preview, Evaluate, Deep research, Apply, Tracker, Reports, all 7 modes, Activity log, Health, setup hints. Auto-built sticky table of contents from `<h2>` headings, synchronous DOM build (no race). Localized for all 8 supported locales.
- **`feat(config): in-UI App settings page` (`/#/config`)** — edit `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, `HH_USER_AGENT`, `PORT`, `HOST` from the browser. Writes to the **parent project's** `.env` file so career-ops Node scripts AND web-ui's dotenv loader pick up the same source. Secret keys masked on read (first/last 4 chars). Model fields are dropdowns with curated lists (claude-sonnet-4-6 / claude-opus-4-7 / claude-haiku-4-5 / gemini-2.0-flash / etc.). Empty value deletes the key. Values applied to running process.env immediately — no restart for most settings.
- **`feat(modes): "⚡ Show result" button alongside "Copy prompt"`** — when a prompt is generated in manual mode, users no longer have to retype their inputs to get the LLM result. The new button re-submits the same form with `run: true`, falling through to a clear toast (`Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY in .env first`) when no key is configured. Works on `/#/deep`, `/#/project`, `/#/training`, `/#/followup`, `/#/batch`, `/#/contacto`, `/#/interview-prep`, `/#/patterns`.

### 🐛 UX + UI fixes

- **`fix(scan): single Scan button replaces three (Scan all + EN + RU)`** — overwhelming choice, identical default in 99% of cases. The unified `🌐 Scan` button runs every enabled source. Help docs updated across 8 locales.
- **`fix(ui): mobile sidebar drawer`** — viewport <900px now gets a hamburger button (☰) in the topbar; `body.sidebar-open` toggles a CSS transform that slides the sidebar in. Backdrop dim + click-anywhere closes it. Anchor click + hashchange auto-close so the user lands on the new page with the drawer tucked away. Larger viewports unaffected.
- **`fix(server): footer version reflects web-ui, not the parent VERSION`** — `/api/health` now reads web-ui's own `package.json`. The footer no longer leaks a stale `1.6.0` from the parent's version file. Parent's VERSION is still surfaced separately as `parentVersion`.

### 📦 New REST endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET`  | `/api/help/:lang` | Returns the Markdown user guide for the requested locale, falling back to `en.md`. Path-traversal-safe. |
| `GET`  | `/api/config` | Returns current values for all known env keys; secrets masked. |
| `POST` | `/api/config` | Writes the given keys into the parent project's `.env`, validates each value, applies live to `process.env`. |

### 🌐 i18n

- 30+ new keys across `nav.help`, `nav.config`, `help.*`, `config.*`, `deep.showResult`, `deep.needKey`, `scan.btnRun`. All 8 locales populated.

### 🧪 Tests

- `tests/help.test.mjs` (12 cases) — every supported locale returns substantive markdown, EN spot-checks every page slug, unknown lang → EN fallback, path-traversal sanitized, every locale references `cv.md` / `profile.yml` / `.env`.
- `tests/help-ui.test.mjs` (9 cases) — view file registration, sidebar entry, i18n keys present in every locale, docs files exist for every locale, EN/RU help has 14 canonical sections, every #/foo route covered, Show-result wiring on deep + mode-page.
- `tests/env-config.test.mjs` (18 cases) — pure-function tests for `parseEnv`, `maskSecret`, `validateConfig`, `updateEnvFile` (bootstrap, in-place rewrite preserving comments, empty-value delete, quote-when-needed).
- `tests/config-endpoint.test.mjs` (8 cases) — GET masks secrets / returns env path; POST writes to parent .env; live process.env application; empty-value unsets; rejects unknown keys + malformed Anthropic keys with 400.

### 📊 Stats

- **Tests:** 233 → **277** (+44 across 4 new test files).
- **E2E:** 20 smoke + 23 comprehensive = 43 Playwright steps, all green.
- **Coverage:** 93.5% line / 82.6% branch / 93.7% funcs (unchanged — new code is fully tested).

## [1.7.1] — 2026-05-04

Patch release stacking the post-v1.7.0 work: pipeline preview pane, Anthropic API integration, scrollable sidebar, dotenv loader, dynamic Active-companies list, CI workflow hardening.

### ✨ Pipeline preview pane

- **`/#/pipeline` overhaul** — left list + right preview pane. Click any URL to fetch a server-side proxied snapshot (`GET /api/pipeline/preview` strips scripts/styles/tags, caps at 8 KB, validated through `isValidJobUrl`). Live filter input, "In queue" counter, ⚡ "Evaluate first" header button. Inline ▶/✕ on every row plus full Evaluate / Open in tab / Delete on the preview pane. Stable test selectors via `data-url` + `.pipeline-row` + `.pipeline-row-delete` classes. **8 new tests** in `tests/pipeline-preview.test.mjs` (mocked fetch, no upstream binding needed).

### ✨ Anthropic API integration — "Run live" everywhere

- **`server/lib/anthropic.mjs`** — zero-dependency client for Anthropic Messages API (claude-sonnet-4-6 default, override via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`). When `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, every mode page (`/#/deep`, `/#/project`, `/#/training`, `/#/batch`, `/#/contacto`, `/#/interview-prep`, `/#/patterns`) renders an "⚡ Run live (Anthropic)" button as the **primary** action — clicking executes the prompt and renders Markdown back into the browser instead of handing off to Claude Code. Gemini stays as fallback when only its key is set. Manual mode still works with no keys at all. **8 new tests** in `tests/anthropic.test.mjs`.

### 🐛 CI / pipeline fixes

- **`fix(api): tighten pipeline URL validator` (FIX-M7)** — now also rejects loopback hostnames, length <10 or >2000, whitespace inside URLs.
- **`fix(server): actually load .env so HH_USER_AGENT / GEMINI_API_KEY hints work`** — added `server/lib/dotenv.mjs` (35-line zero-dep loader) wired in at the top of `server/index.mjs`. The runtime hints in scanner code finally do something. **6 new tests**.
- **`fix(ui): scrollable sidebar`** — 18 nav items in 6 groups overflowed shorter viewports. `.sidebar` now has `overflow-y: auto` with thin custom-styled scrollbars.
- **`fix(ui): make HH_USER_AGENT banner dismissible`** — then removed entirely from `/scan` once we realized it was overkill. Health page check still surfaces it.
- **`fix(scan): Active companies list is now collapsible + filterable + grouped`** — 87 tags flat was overwhelming. Now a "▸ Active companies 87/71" toggle expands an ordered list (✓ API-backed first, ○ websearch second) plus a search filter.
- **`fix(test): isolate api.test.mjs + en-scanner.test.mjs from parent project`** — both now spin up tmp project roots so CI works without the parent checked out alongside web-ui.
- **`fix(workflow): publish-package version-match only on release events`** — `workflow_dispatch` from main no longer fails the tag/version check.
- **`fix(e2e): stable selector for pipeline row delete`** — restored anchor wrapper + added `data-url` attribute so e2e suite is selector-stable.

### 📦 New REST endpoint

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/pipeline/preview?url=…` | Server-side proxy: returns visible-text snapshot of the URL (scripts/styles stripped, 8 KB cap), gated by `isValidJobUrl`. |

### 📊 Stats after this batch

- **Tests:** 225 → **233** (8 more on top of v1.7.0).
- **Test files:** 25 → **26**.
- **E2E:** 20 + 23 = 43 Playwright steps, all green.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-05-03

A 35-commit hardening + UX + feature-completion pass driven by QA r5. Three security layers landed (XSS sanitization, CSP, input validation), every missing CRUD endpoint was filled in, the parent-project bootstrap is now fully automated, and the UI gained **9 new pages** — Activity, redesigned Deep Research, plus 7 sidebar-grouped modes (project / training / followup / batch / outreach / interview-prep / patterns) covering 100% of parent's `modes/`. Pipeline gained a server-side preview pane. Anthropic API integration makes "Run live" a one-click action across all modes. Test coverage went from **73** to **225**, across **25 test files**, plus **23 comprehensive Playwright e2e steps**. GitHub Actions ship CI / AI review / Release / Publish-Package workflows.

### 🔒 Security

- **`fix(cv): sanitize CV markdown to block stored XSS in preview` (FIX-C10)** — `PUT /api/cv` now strips `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<style>`, `<form>`, `<svg>`, `on*=` event handlers, and `javascript:`/`vbscript:`/`data:text/html` URIs before writing `cv.md`. Body capped at 1 MB (413 on overflow). Client-side `UI.md()` was rewritten to escape every byte before any markdown transformation runs, so raw HTML can never reach `innerHTML`. Link `href` attributes are validated against an allowlist of safe schemes (`http`/`https`/`mailto`/`tel`/relative + `data:image` only). 17 new tests across the strip helper and HTTP round-trips.
- **`fix(server): add CSP and baseline security headers` (FIX-L2)** — every response now carries `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`. When the server binds beyond loopback (`HOST` ≠ `127.0.0.1`/`::1`/`localhost`), a strict `Content-Security-Policy` is layered on top: `default-src 'self'`, `script-src 'self'` (no `unsafe-inline`), Google Fonts whitelisted, `connect-src 'self'` blocks XSS exfiltration. Inline `onclick` handlers in `index.html` and `router.js` were moved to `addEventListener` to keep the strict CSP intact. 8 new tests gating CSP across 5 different `HOST` values.
- **`fix(api): tighten pipeline URL validator` (FIX-M7)** — `POST /api/pipeline` used to accept `"not-a-url"` and persist it. Now `isValidJobUrl()` rejects bare strings, inputs <10 or >2000 chars, whitespace-containing URLs, non-`http(s)` schemes, and loopback hostnames (`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`::1`). Folds in **FIX-M3** + **FIX-M6** (return 400 on invalid, plus a `deduped` flag on success).
- **`fix(server): actually load .env so HH_USER_AGENT / GEMINI_API_KEY hints work`** — previously the runtime told users to "set HH_USER_AGENT in .env" but the server never read that file, so following the instruction did nothing. Adds a 35-line zero-dependency dotenv loader (`server/lib/dotenv.mjs`) wired in at the top of `server/index.mjs`. Process-env values set on the command line still win, so existing CI overrides aren't shadowed. Parent's `.env.example` now includes a documented `HH_USER_AGENT` block with a real-Chrome User-Agent example. 6 new tests.
- **`fix(api): sanitize JD before prompt assembly` (FIX-M5)** — `POST /api/evaluate` strips ANSI escapes, control bytes, inline `<script>` tags, and trims whitespace before either calling Gemini or echoing the prompt back. 50 KB length cap. The 50-char minimum runs against the *sanitized* text, so prompt-injection attempts that look long enough but consist mostly of escapes fail-fast with 400.
- **`fix(health): mask Node version + project root when HOST!=loopback` (FIX-M1)** — `/api/health` no longer fingerprints the host on LAN-exposed deployments. Loopback responses keep the values for local diagnostics.

### ✨ New features

- **`feat: 7 new sidebar modes + grouped sidebar` (FIX-C8)** — covers 100% of the parent's `modes/` directory with no UI gaps. New routes: `#/project` (portfolio project advisor), `#/training` (course / cert evaluation), `#/followup` (per-application cadence), `#/batch` (parallel URL processor), `#/contacto` (LinkedIn outreach drafter), `#/interview-prep` (stage-specific prep), `#/patterns` (rejection-pattern analyzer). All seven share a single config-driven view factory (`public/js/views/mode-page.js`) and a single generic endpoint `POST /api/mode/:slug` — adding a new mode in the future is one config row + one i18n block. Sidebar reorganized into 6 groups: Sourcing / Decision / Application / Networking / Analytics / Setup. 18 nav items total. 12 new tests in `tests/modes-endpoints.test.mjs`.
- **`fix: bootstrap parent deps + russian_portals defaults` (FIX-C4 + C9 + C12 + H2)** — `bin/start.sh` now installs the parent's `node_modules` (js-yaml, playwright, jsdom) AND `npx playwright install chromium` on fresh clones, so `/api/stream/scan`, `/pdf`, and `/liveness` work end-to-end out of the box. `createApp()` probes `portals.yml` on every boot — if the `russian_portals:` block is missing, appends a documented default with comments. Idempotent: the second boot is a no-op. 3 new tests.
- **`fix: disable 9 dead portal slugs in template + health-check script` (FIX-C3)** — `templates/portals.example.yml` now ships with Ada / Factorial / Tinybird / Weights & Biases / Travelperk / Clarity AI / Forto / Vinted / Runway flagged `enabled: false` (each entry has an inline reason comment). New installs scan **87** alive companies instead of 96. New `web-ui/scripts/portals-health-check.mjs` HEAD-probes every enabled `careers_url` and reports DEAD entries with a suggested patch list (JSON output via `--json`). 3 new tests.
- **`feat(activity): user-action log + Activity sidebar page`** — every state-changing API request is captured to `data/activity.jsonl` (timestamp, action verb, target, success flag, optional detail). New sidebar entry **Activity** with action-prefix chip filters (pipeline / cv / jd / evaluate / scan / stream / script), action ✓/✗ badges, and refresh button. Auto-rotates at 5 MB. 10 new tests covering middleware, read filters, corrupt-line tolerance, and the recursion guard for `GET /api/activity` itself.
- **`feat(deep): view Deep Research in browser + saved-results archive`** — the Deep Research page now (a) runs the prompt through Gemini live when `{ run: true }` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set, persisting output to `interview-prep/{slug}.md`; (b) lists every saved deep-research file as clickable cards with relative timestamps; (c) renders results as Markdown with **📋 Copy / ⬇ Download .md / ↗ Open in tab** actions per result. New REST surface: `GET /api/interview-prep`, `GET /api/interview-prep/:name`, `DELETE /api/interview-prep/:name`. 7 new tests.
- **`feat(cv): generate + download PDF in browser, with PDF archive`** — new **📄 Generate PDF** button on the CV page streams `/api/stream/pdf` in a modal console. On `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` / `playwright` errors, it surfaces a copy-pasteable bootstrap command. New "Generated PDFs" section auto-loads after each successful run, listing every `output/*.pdf` with **↗ Open** and **⬇ Download** buttons. New REST surface: `GET /api/output/pdfs`, `GET /api/output/pdfs/:name`. 6 new tests.
- **`feat(api): POST /api/tracker — append rows from the UI` (FIX-H8)** — append a canonical row to `data/applications.md` from the browser. Validates company + role, normalizes status against `templates/states.yml`, auto-increments zero-padded `#`, dedups by company+role (case-insensitive), pipe-escapes notes so the markdown table doesn't fracture. Bootstraps the table when the file is empty. 6 new tests.
- **`feat(api): DELETE /api/jds/:name` (FIX-H4)** — remove saved JDs without shelling out. Path-traversal characters are stripped before any filesystem touch; the parameter must end in `.txt`. 5 new tests, including `../../etc/passwd` refusal.
- **`feat(api): POST /api/evaluate/test-gemini` (FIX-H7)** — smoke-test endpoint that runs a 50-char dummy JD through `gemini-eval.mjs` so the user can verify the API key works without sitting through a real evaluation. Returns `{ ok, code, sampleLength, sample }`.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **`fix(router): catch-all 404 view + i18n coverage guard` (FIX-C7)** — unknown hash routes used to silently fall back to the dashboard, masking typos and broken bookmarks. Now `#/totally-random-xyz` renders a dedicated 404 page that quotes the bad path back and links to the dashboard. The 404 view is registered inside the router IIFE itself so it cannot collide with any user route. New `tests/i18n-coverage.test.mjs` runs `i18n.js` inside a `vm.Context` with a stub `window`, exposes the private `DICT`, and asserts every one of the 173+ keys × 8 locales is populated and non-empty. 4 new router tests.
- **`fix(router): alias #/profile → settings` (FIX-C2)** — the internal route name is `settings` (with `nav.settings` rendering "Profile") but external links and muscle memory go to `#/profile`. Now both addresses reach the same view, and the sidebar nav-item lights up either way. 2 new tests.
- **`fix(health): unify Health/Doctor + flag template profiles` (FIX-C6 + FIX-H6)** — Health and Doctor were two different sources of truth. Now `/api/health` exposes everything Doctor reports (parent-deps, Playwright, dirs, profile-customized, `HH_USER_AGENT`). The `Profile customized` check detects placeholder names (`Jane Smith`, `Alex Doe`, `John Doe`, `Your Name`, `Test User`) and explicit YAML parse errors. 4 new tests.
- **`fix(scan): warn on query↔negative collisions in RU config` (FIX-H3)** — when `portals.yml` ships with `"PHP"` in `title_filter.negative` while the queries target Senior PHP, every match gets filtered and the user sees zero results. `loadConfig()` now computes a `warnings` array; `runRuScan()` emits each warning as an SSE stderr line before the scan starts. 2 new tests verify the shipped defaults stay PHP-friendly out of the box.
- **`fix(scan): warn when HH_USER_AGENT is unset` (FIX-H1)** — the `/scan` page probes `/api/health` and shows a yellow warning card above the action row when `HH_USER_AGENT` is empty, so users know about the hh.ru 403 *before* they click RU scan.
- **`fix(api): warn when POST /api/jds slug had unsafe chars stripped` (FIX-M2)** — slug normalization that strips dangerous characters now returns a `warning` field; pure case/whitespace cleanup stays silent. Empty result after sanitization returns 400.
- **`fix(ui): clear global search on route change + button spinners` (FIX-M4 + FIX-L1)** — the global-search input is cleared on `hashchange` (with a guard for active typing). New `UI.withSpinner(button, fn)` helper wires loading state, ARIA, and double-click prevention into every async button click. Already adopted on Doctor / Verify / sync-check / Save CV / Normalize / Dedup / Merge buttons.
- **`fix(ui): make sidebar scrollable so 18 nav items always reach the footer`** — the grouped sidebar from FIX-C8 overflowed shorter viewports; bottom items (Activity / Health) were clipped. `.sidebar` now has `overflow-y: auto` with thin custom-styled scrollbars (WebKit + Firefox). Footer stays pinned via the existing `margin-top: auto`.
- **`fix(ui): empty modal-title placeholder` (FIX-H9)** — the hardcoded English `"Title"` string in `index.html` is gone, closing the brief race window where it was visible during modal open.

### 🌐 i18n

- 173+ translation keys × 8 supported locales (`en`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `ko`, `ja`, `ru`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`). New keys added across all locales for: 404 page, activity log, deep research, PDF flow, security warnings, tracker mutation, apply rename. Coverage is now enforced by `tests/i18n-coverage.test.mjs` — every key must have a non-empty value in every supported locale or CI fails.

### ⚙️ DevOps

- **Test count:** 73 → **201** (+128 tests across 23 test files). The single remaining failing test (`runEnScan: dry-run end-to-end across multiple sources`) is a pre-existing flake dependent on Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever live API responses.
- **Comprehensive Playwright e2e** (`tests/e2e-comprehensive.mjs`, 23 steps): walks the full user journey — CV save → preview → PDF generation → all 7 new modes → tracker filters → activity log → 404 → modal ESC → sidebar scroll → Ctrl-K focus → search clear → profile alias → language persistence.
- **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/`):
  - `ci.yml` — unit + integration tests on Node 18/20/22 matrix, plus i18n coverage gate (every key × 8 locales must be non-empty), plus the full Playwright e2e on every PR.
  - `ai-review.yml` — Claude Code AI review on every PR. Maintainers retain merge authority; Claude only suggests. Skip via `skip-ai-review` label.
  - `release.yml` — auto-publish a GitHub Release when a `v*.*.*` tag is pushed; release notes are sliced from `CHANGELOG.md` so all 8 language variants stay the canonical source.
- **CSP-friendly UI:** all inline `onclick` handlers removed from `index.html` and `router.js`. The strict `script-src 'self'` policy is now enforceable without breaking any feature.
