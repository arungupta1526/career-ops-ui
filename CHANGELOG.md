## [1.7.0] — 2026-05-03

A 21-commit hardening + UX pass driven by the v1.6.0 QA report. Three security layers landed (XSS sanitization, CSP, input validation), the missing CRUD endpoints were filled in (DELETE jds, POST tracker), and the UI gained two new pages — **Activity** and a redesigned **Deep Research** that runs in the browser. Test coverage went from **73** to **177**, with **14 new test files**.

### 🔒 Security

- **`fix(cv): sanitize CV markdown to block stored XSS in preview` (FIX-C10)** — `PUT /api/cv` now strips `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<style>`, `<form>`, `<svg>`, `on*=` event handlers, and `javascript:`/`vbscript:`/`data:text/html` URIs before writing `cv.md`. Body capped at 1 MB (413 on overflow). Client-side `UI.md()` was rewritten to escape every byte before any markdown transformation runs, so raw HTML can never reach `innerHTML`. Link `href` attributes are validated against an allowlist of safe schemes (`http`/`https`/`mailto`/`tel`/relative + `data:image` only). 17 new tests across the strip helper and HTTP round-trips.
- **`fix(server): add CSP and baseline security headers` (FIX-L2)** — every response now carries `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`. When the server binds beyond loopback (`HOST` ≠ `127.0.0.1`/`::1`/`localhost`), a strict `Content-Security-Policy` is layered on top: `default-src 'self'`, `script-src 'self'` (no `unsafe-inline`), Google Fonts whitelisted, `connect-src 'self'` blocks XSS exfiltration. Inline `onclick` handlers in `index.html` and `router.js` were moved to `addEventListener` to keep the strict CSP intact. 8 new tests gating CSP across 5 different `HOST` values.
- **`fix(api): tighten pipeline URL validator` (FIX-M7)** — `POST /api/pipeline` used to accept `"not-a-url"` and persist it. Now `isValidJobUrl()` rejects bare strings, inputs <10 or >2000 chars, whitespace-containing URLs, non-`http(s)` schemes, and loopback hostnames (`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`::1`). Folds in **FIX-M3** + **FIX-M6** (return 400 on invalid, plus a `deduped` flag on success).
- **`fix(api): sanitize JD before prompt assembly` (FIX-M5)** — `POST /api/evaluate` strips ANSI escapes, control bytes, inline `<script>` tags, and trims whitespace before either calling Gemini or echoing the prompt back. 50 KB length cap. The 50-char minimum runs against the *sanitized* text, so prompt-injection attempts that look long enough but consist mostly of escapes fail-fast with 400.
- **`fix(health): mask Node version + project root when HOST!=loopback` (FIX-M1)** — `/api/health` no longer fingerprints the host on LAN-exposed deployments. Loopback responses keep the values for local diagnostics.

### ✨ New features

- **`feat(activity): user-action log + Activity sidebar page`** — every state-changing API request is captured to `data/activity.jsonl` (timestamp, action verb, target, success flag, optional detail). New sidebar entry **Activity** with action-prefix chip filters (pipeline / cv / jd / evaluate / scan / stream / script), action ✓/✗ badges, and refresh button. Auto-rotates at 5 MB. 10 new tests covering middleware, read filters, corrupt-line tolerance, and the recursion guard for `GET /api/activity` itself.
- **`feat(deep): view Deep Research in browser + saved-results archive`** — the Deep Research page now (a) runs the prompt through Gemini live when `{ run: true }` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set, persisting output to `interview-prep/{slug}.md`; (b) lists every saved deep-research file as clickable cards with relative timestamps; (c) renders results as Markdown with **📋 Copy / ⬇ Download .md / ↗ Open in tab** actions per result. New REST surface: `GET /api/interview-prep`, `GET /api/interview-prep/:name`, `DELETE /api/interview-prep/:name`. 7 new tests.
- **`feat(cv): generate + download PDF in browser, with PDF archive`** — new **📄 Generate PDF** button on the CV page streams `/api/stream/pdf` in a modal console. On `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` / `playwright` errors, it surfaces a copy-pasteable bootstrap command. New "Generated PDFs" section auto-loads after each successful run, listing every `output/*.pdf` with **↗ Open** and **⬇ Download** buttons. New REST surface: `GET /api/output/pdfs`, `GET /api/output/pdfs/:name`. 6 new tests.
- **`feat(api): POST /api/tracker — append rows from the UI` (FIX-H8)** — append a canonical row to `data/applications.md` from the browser. Validates company + role, normalizes status against `templates/states.yml`, auto-increments zero-padded `#`, dedups by company+role (case-insensitive), pipe-escapes notes so the markdown table doesn't fracture. Bootstraps the table when the file is empty. 6 new tests.
- **`feat(api): DELETE /api/jds/:name` (FIX-H4)** — remove saved JDs without shelling out. Path-traversal characters are stripped before any filesystem touch; the parameter must end in `.txt`. 5 new tests, including `../../etc/passwd` refusal.
- **`feat(api): POST /api/evaluate/test-gemini` (FIX-H7)** — smoke-test endpoint that runs a 50-char dummy JD through `gemini-eval.mjs` so the user can verify the API key works without sitting through a real evaluation. Returns `{ ok, code, sampleLength, sample }`.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **`fix(router): catch-all 404 view + i18n coverage guard` (FIX-C7)** — unknown hash routes used to silently fall back to the dashboard, masking typos and broken bookmarks. Now `#/totally-random-xyz` renders a dedicated 404 page that quotes the bad path back and links to the dashboard. The 404 view is registered inside the router IIFE itself so it cannot collide with any user route. New `tests/i18n-coverage.test.mjs` runs `i18n.js` inside a `vm.Context` with a stub `window`, exposes the private `DICT`, and asserts every one of the 173+ keys × 8 locales is populated and non-empty. 4 new router tests.
- **`fix(router): alias #/profile → settings` (FIX-C2)** — the internal route name is `settings` (with `nav.settings` rendering "Profile") but external links and muscle memory go to `#/profile`. Now both addresses reach the same view, and the sidebar nav-item lights up either way. 2 new tests.
- **`fix(health): unify Health/Doctor + flag template profiles` (FIX-C6 + FIX-H6)** — Health and Doctor were two different sources of truth. Now `/api/health` exposes everything Doctor reports (parent-deps, Playwright, dirs, profile-customized, `HH_USER_AGENT`). The `Profile customized` check detects placeholder names (`Jane Smith`, `Alex Doe`, `John Doe`, `Your Name`, `Test User`) and explicit YAML parse errors. 4 new tests.
- **`fix(scan): warn on query↔negative collisions in RU config` (FIX-H3)** — when `portals.yml` ships with `"PHP"` in `title_filter.negative` while the queries target Senior PHP, every match gets filtered and the user sees zero results. `loadConfig()` now computes a `warnings` array; `runRuScan()` emits each warning as an SSE stderr line before the scan starts. 2 new tests verify the shipped defaults stay PHP-friendly out of the box.
- **`fix(scan): warn when HH_USER_AGENT is unset` (FIX-H1)** — the `/scan` page probes `/api/health` and shows a yellow warning card above the action row when `HH_USER_AGENT` is empty, so users know about the hh.ru 403 *before* they click RU scan.
- **`fix(api): warn when POST /api/jds slug had unsafe chars stripped` (FIX-M2)** — slug normalization that strips dangerous characters now returns a `warning` field; pure case/whitespace cleanup stays silent. Empty result after sanitization returns 400.
- **`fix(ui): clear global search on route change + button spinners` (FIX-M4 + FIX-L1)** — the global-search input is cleared on `hashchange` (with a guard for active typing). New `UI.withSpinner(button, fn)` helper wires loading state, ARIA, and double-click prevention into every async button click. Already adopted on Doctor / Verify / sync-check / Save CV / Normalize / Dedup / Merge buttons.
- **`fix(ui): empty modal-title placeholder` (FIX-H9)** — the hardcoded English `"Title"` string in `index.html` is gone, closing the brief race window where it was visible during modal open.

### 🌐 i18n

- 173+ translation keys × 8 supported locales (`en`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `ko`, `ja`, `ru`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`). New keys added across all locales for: 404 page, activity log, deep research, PDF flow, security warnings, tracker mutation, apply rename. Coverage is now enforced by `tests/i18n-coverage.test.mjs` — every key must have a non-empty value in every supported locale or CI fails.

### ⚙️ DevOps

- **Test count:** 73 → **177** (+104 tests across 14 new files). The single failing test (`runEnScan: dry-run end-to-end across multiple sources`) is a pre-existing flake dependent on Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever live API responses.
- **CSP-friendly UI:** all inline `onclick` handlers removed from `index.html` and `router.js`. The strict `script-src 'self'` policy is now enforceable without breaking any feature.
